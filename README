==========
INSTALLING
==========

First of all, read the "dependencies" file and install all of them.

Choose your destination directory (where the files will be installed), and use
the following command:

$ make DESTDIR=/home/myUser/mdm-testing/ install

You will also need a new Xephyr with the -geometry patch, and a patched Xlib so
the Xephyr will not keep crashing. For ubutnu-8.04 users, do this:

$ cd distro/ubuntu-8.04
$ make

Then install the xserver-xephyr and libx11-6 packages with "dpkg -i".

You will also want to "hold" these packages so that apt will not replace them.

For non-ubuntu users, apply the patches manually. They are located in the
distro/generic directory.

=======
RUNNING
=======

Go to the directory previously chosen as the destination.

Edit the mdm.conf file to adapt it to your needs:

$ vim ./etc/mdm/mdm.conf

Run the service:

$ ./etc/init.d/mdm start

To stop the service use:

$ ./etc/init.d/mdm stop
