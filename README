==========
INSTALLING
==========

To install everything you have two options:
 - you can just go to the "compiled" directory and install everything that is
   already there (the easy way, but not guaranteed to be the most recent
   version)
 - or you can compile everything again and install them (the other way,
   recommended)


= THE EASY WAY =

Change to the "compiled" directory.
Change to your distribution's directory.

Install the packages in the following order:
 - libx11-6
 - xserver-xephyr
 - mdm
 - any mdm extra mode you might want

For Debian/Ubuntu users, use "dpkg -i" to install a package

Then, add the libx11-6 and xserver-xephyr packages to the "hold" state.

For Debian/Ubuntu users:
echo "libx11-6 hold" | dpkg --set-selectionis
echo "xserver-xephyr hold" | dpkg --set-selectionis


= THE OTHER WAY =

First, you need to install the "mdm" dependencies:
 - xserver-xephyr with the "-geometry" patch
 - libx11-6 with a patch to make Xephyr stop randomly crashing

Go to the "dependencies" directory, then type 
 - sudo make $(your-distribution-name)-install

This command will download the sources, apply the patches and install the
packages. It might take a while to do this.

Now, go to the "mdm" directory, ans use the same command:
 - sudo make $(your-distribution-name)-install

Finally, if you need any extra modes, go to its directory and use the same
command again:
 - sudo make $(your-distribution-name)-install


=======
RUNNING
=======

First of all, stop gdm, kdm, xdm and your running X sessions.
 - /etc/init.d/gdm stop

Then, edit the /etc/mdm/mdm.conf file to use your preferred mode with your
custom settings
 - vim /etc/mdm/mdm.conf

Finally, start mdm:
 - /etc/init.d/mdm start

To stop the service use:

$ /etc/init.d/mdm stop
