==========
INSTALLING
==========

Go to the "bin" directory.
Choose the prefix for the instalation, and put it as an argument to the command
change-prefix.sh:

$ ./change-prefix.sh /home/myuser/mdm-testing/

(soon this step will be replaced by a make --prefix)

Now go back to the repository root directory, and "make install"

$ make install

=======
RUNNING
=======

Go to the directory previously chose as the "prefix".

Edit the mdm.conf file to adapt it to your needs:

$ vim ./etc/mdm/mdm.conf

Run the service:

$ ./etc/init.d/mdm start

To stop the service:

$ ./etc/init.d/mdm stop
