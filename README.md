MultiDM - Multiseat Display Manager Wrapper
===========================================

This is a fork of original C3SL's MDM source code, intended to be compatible with new Linux Mint's Display Manager (also called MDM), forked from old MDM 2.20, with which C3SL's MDM works. An alternative mode compatible with Canonical's LightDM is in the plans.

Original C3SL's MDM source code can be found at [C3SL Git Repository](http://git.c3sl.ufpr.br/gitweb?p=multiseat/mdm.git).
