Description: The Multiseat package configures a multiseat system, containing 
two or more videocards, keyboards and mice, allowing two or more users to use 
the system at the same time.

Dependencies: Multiseat depends on a patched Xephyr, which is a X client that 
runs as the X server to other aplications, allowing the system to work with 
more than one user locally logged in.

More information about installing and configuring the system can be found in:
