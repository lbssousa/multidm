---------------
On-going tasks:

Aramis: testing and fixing possible bugs
Lucas: creating new Live-CD, working with internationalization
Paulo: documenting, TODO editing, bug fixing.

-----------------
Easy/small tasks:

- Fix the ugly Makefiles
- Add internationalization support to the messages written on the screen.
- Add a script to detect the dependencies? (decide if needed)
- Remove "/etc/init.d/gdm start" in mode xephyr-gdm. We should just try to
  detect if it is open and fail if not.
- See if our distributions' "gdm.conf" is like the distribution sets it, and
  make patches for gdm.conf if needed.
- Change Ubuntu's libx11 patch (use fd.o's bug #6820 latest patch)
- Every time we call X, wait for SIGUSR1 (make it send us the signal first).
- Indentation use both tabs and spaces. Use only spaces (fix the whole code!).
  Do this in a separate commit.
- Should we stop printing useless parts of xorg.conf since everyone has a xorg
  server > 1.4 ?
- The xrandr_funtions stuff should be moved to inside the modes. Not every mode
  will want this.
- Now that xrandr_functions were added, the scripts are not respecting the
  screen resolution (mode). Fix this.
- When you start mdm with monoseat, the mdm-bin process never ends. This breaks
  the init.d file, which runs mdm-bin in "foreground". Maybe the ideal fix would
  not be to start mdm-bin in background, but do something else.
- Don't make xephyr-gdm mode open gdm. In Debian, doing this will print some
  error messages. Make it detect if gdm is open first.

------------------
Medium/hard tasks:

- Create a mode to use multiple X servers. To do this we'll need big changes,
  specially in the configuration process. mdm will have to get a lot more
  "generic" to do this.
- Change discover_devices find a better way to detect input devices
- Fix the problem with "mdm stop" (talk to Paulo for more info about this)
- Create a mode that uses VNC!
- Create other useful modes for UFPR informatics department (sibi, provas, boca,
  fradim-machines)
- Add different behavior for things like "--purge" on debian {pre,post}{inst,rm}
- Create a mailing list
- Use some kind of bug tracking system
- mdm package should not depend on Xephyr. Remove it and make a separate mode
  for xephyr-xdmcp. This way, mdm will have no "default" modes.
- In mode xephyr-gdm, if xephyr keeps dying (quickly), gdm shows a strange
  message and  sometimes it stops working. Investigate why. Fix it. There must
  be some sort of timeout we need to disable
- In mode xephyr-gdm, find a way to allow reconfiguring input when Xephyr dies.
- Release 1.0.0 when everything else is done.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Things you'll need to commit outside your repository (mainly X work):

- Remove the need for patched libx11
- Fix the "? /" abnt2 key (in X)
- Fix ctrl+alt+backspace in Xephyr

-------------------
Never-ending tasks:

- Test a lot!
- Always update the repositories and the compiled dir
- Update the wiki to reflect our changes!
- Tell everyone about the package
- Update this document.
- Improve documentation!
- Make versions for other distros!
- Be sure that our package works with other architectures, and add them on
  DEBIAN/config and other files
- Make people READ, USE and UPDATE this file!
- echo "$(egrep -r "(TODO|XXX|FIXME)" *)"
