On-going tasks:

Aramis: adding support for cards with multiple outputs
Lucas: Creating new Live-CD
Paulo: documenting, TODO editing, small fixes

-----------------
Easy/small tasks:

- Fix the ugly Makefiles
- Add internationalization support to the messages written on the screen.
- Add a script to detect the dependencies? (decide if needed)
- Change the "/etc/init.d/gdm start" in mode xephyr-gdm because it makes the
  init-functions output ugly too
- See if our distributions' "gdm.conf" is like the distribution sets it, and
  make patches for gdm.conf if needed.
- Change Ubuntu's libx11 patch (use fd.o's bug #6820 latest patch)
- Change Debian-based way to discover drivers (use driver.ids files)

------------------
Medium/hard tasks:

- Change discover_devices:
	- find a better way to detect input devices (HAL?)
	- find a better way to detect video cards (Xorg?)
- Fix the problem with "mdm stop" (talk to Paulo for more info about this)
- Create a mode that uses VNC!
- Create other useful modes for UFPR informatics department (sibi, provas, boca,
  fradim-machines)
- Add different behavior for things like "--purge" on debian {pre,post}{inst,rm}
- When things become stable, make release 0.0.2 and "release" the scripts to the
  community
- Create a mailing list
- Use some kind of bug tracking system


---------------------------------------------------------------------
